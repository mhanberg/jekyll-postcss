# Jekyll  PostCSS
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/mhanberg/jekyll-postcss.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/mhanberg/jekyll-postcss)
[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/jekyll-postcss.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/jekyll-postcss)

A plugin to use PostCSS plugins like [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer) or [Tailwind CSS](https://github.com/tailwindcss/tailwindcss) with Jekyll.

The goal of this project is to be able to use modern CSS tooling with Jekyll, without the hassle of dealing with other build tools. It should be as easy as `bundle exec jekyll serve`.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'jekyll-postcss'
```

And then add this line to your application's `_config.yml`:

```yml
# _config.yml

plugins:
  - jekyll-postcss
```

## Usage

Make sure you have [postcss](https://github.com/postcss/postcss) installed.

Add your PostCSS plugins to a `postcss.config.js` file in the root of your repository.

```javascript
// postcss.config.js

module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    require("autoprefixer"), // example of plugin you might use
    ...(process.env.JEKYLL_ENV == "production" // example of only using a plugin in production
      ? [require("cssnano")({ preset: "default" })]
      : [])
  ]
};
```

All CSS and SCSS/Sass files will now be processed by PostCSS.

### SCSS/Sass

If using SCSS/Sass, you must have [postcss-scss](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-scss) installed and configured in your `postcss.config.js`

```javascript
module.exports = {
  parser: 'postcss-scss',
  plugins: [
    // ...
  ]
};
```

### Caching

Caching is enabled by default so PostCSS will only be called when the CSS content has changed. If needed you can disable caching in your Jekyll configuration to force the CSS to be recompiled every time.

If you are using the [TailwindCSS JIT](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/just-in-time-mode), you most likely need to disable the caching feature.

```yaml
# _config.yml

postcss:
  cache: false
```

### Deployment

When deploying, make sure to set your `JEKYLL_ENV` to something like `production` or `staging`. This is necessary to make sure that jekyll-postcss will not use internal development conveniences when building on your host's servers.

This can be done so by setting your build command like so

```shell
JEKYLL_ENV=production bundle exec jekyll build
```

or using your hosts proprietary configuration. Here is an example using Netlify.

```toml
# netlify.toml

[context.production.environment]
  JEKYLL_ENV = "production"

[context.branch-deploy.environment]
  JEKYLL_ENV = "staging"

[context.deploy-preview.environment]
  JEKYLL_ENV = "staging"
```

### Front Matter Reminder

Your stylesheets still need to have [front matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/03-front-matter/) for them to be processed by Jekyll.

```

/* Example using Tailwind */
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

## Alternatives 

- [postcss-jekyll-v2](https://github.com/bglw/jekyll-postcss-v2): works well with TailwindCSS 2.0  
[bridgetown](https://github.com/bridgetownrb/bridgetown) - A Jekyll fork, which uses Weback for modern JS and CSS and is actively maintained. 

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
